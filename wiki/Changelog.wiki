====0.2 {{{(02.25.2011)}}}====
  * Added 1 unused domination line for scout (need to build vcds for other 2)
  * Added melee dare responses for Scout. Point at enemy with a melee weapon, do battle cry voice command to use.
  * Added prototype assist kill response system for Scout (kill >1 players, say voice command "Thanks", 50 percent chance of occurring)
  * Added double jump apex responses for Scout
  * Added a Criterion in response_rules.txt to make it only fire when he's in the air, not when he's on the ground.
  * Excluded Skullcutter from the eyelander taunt
  * Fixed Frying Pan criterion to use correct name.
  * Frying Pan now has its own kill response rule - no more "bottle o' scrumpy" line.
  * Removed superfluous criterion in Demoman.txt melee kill rules

  * Modified Scout kill assist rule to be less prone to spamming. Can only be fired 1 in 20 seconds (in time with recent kill ticker) after a kill. This may need further tweaking.

  * Added assist lines for Demoman. Say thanks after a kill.

  * Added a new criterion to response_rules.txt "IsBeingHealed"
