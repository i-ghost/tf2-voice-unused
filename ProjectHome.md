# Aim #
This project aims to implement all the unused vocal lines and/or taunts in the videogame Team Fortress 2.

# Objectives #
  * To discover all unused voice lines within the game.
  * To implement said lines into the voice response system.
  * To create unique responses based on unique subsets of rules. (e.g. fire a concept if an enemy was outside or within a certain range, or if your health was < or > a value.)

# Why? #
After every major class update, VALVe added many voice lines for the respective class that received an update. Sadly, **almost all** of these have not been implemented, or have been improperly implemented, into the response rule system.
